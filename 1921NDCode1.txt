After taking control of the North Dakota legislature, the Nonpartisan League and Governor Lynn Frazier passed a series of sweeping reforms and relief bills meant to revolutionize the state's economy. Unfortunately for the NPL, this experiment has gotten off to a rocky start, with vicious backlash against the NPL and a poor economy, serious opposition has emerged in the Independent Voters Association. After successfully bringing forth a recall, the League and Governor Frazier now must fight for their lives, defending their record in charge of the state. The IVA and Ragnvald Nestos must hammer on the League's many flaws, and convince North Dakota that they would be better in power.","image_url":"https://i.imgur.com/94qkOMC.jpg","winning_electoral_vote_number":0,"advisor_url":"https://i.imgur.com/5eRBV6X.jpg","recommended_reading":"<h4 style=\\\"margin-top: 0.5em;\\\">Links and Sources for This Election</h4><a href=\\\"https://www.history.nd.gov/pdf/ArchivesSubjectGuide-LynnFrazier.pdf\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">Sources on The Nonpartisan League and Lynn Frazier</a><br><a href=\\\"https://www.pbs.org/video/part-1-well-stick-well-win-oprx5o/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">The Rise and Fall of The Nonpartisan League</a><p>Hello all, thanks for playing my first mod as part of this mod jam.

A plain spoken, humble potato farmer from the tiny town of Hoople, Frazier was specifically recruited by Lemke and Townley despite lacking any previous political experience or office. In Bismarck, Frazier has proven himself a capable governor in his 5 years in office. But now, in response to the sharply progressive reforms enacted over the last few years, intense conservative backlash has led to the recall of Frazier, Attorney General Lemke, and Commission of Agriculture Hagan. Amidst charges of bolshevism, atheism, and incompetency, Frazier must make the case that the League has been and will bringing relief to the people of North Dakota.","color_hex":"#8c510a","secondary_color_hex":null,"is_active":1,"image_url":"https://i.imgur.com/a5V6Bmr.jpg","electoral_victory_message":"<h3>LEAGUE LEADERS AND PLATFORM UPHELD, FRAZIER DISLODGES NESTOS IN CLOSE CONTEST.</h3><p>It has been weeks since election day, and as you read this headline, you breath a sigh of relief. With the amount of controversies, misteps, and scandals the League has put itself in over the past few years, many predicted that this recall would mark the death of the League. However, you have shown to North Dakota and America as a whole that the Nonpartisan League is still a force to be reckoned with in politics. On top of this, both Lemke and Hagan survived their recalls, and North Dakotans universally voted in favor of retaining every law on the ballot. Despite this, the League has still been wounded by this, with Townley being convicted of violation of the Sedition Act on trumped up charges, the party must go on without their leader and declining funds to finance future campaings. However, for now, relish in this victory, and be prepared to get North Dakota out of its current rut and into the light of Economic Democracy.","electoral_loss_message":"<h3>FRAZIER RECALLED, BUT PROGRAM IS SAVED.</h3><p>You gaze at this headline after nearly a week of ballot counting. It's hard not to be disappointed in it, and you try your best, even joking to friends that you'd rather have lost so you could go back to Hoople to fix up your farm that was falling into disrepair. But this defeat is still crushing to the NPL, and it's a blow they likely won't recover from for a long time. Along with you, Lemke and Hagan were also recalled, but surprisingly, North Dakota has upheld every single ballot measure trying to revoke the NPL's program. North Dakota proved that while they support the platform, the do not support the leaders, and with the loss of significant funds and leadership these past few years, the future looks grim for the NPL.<p>However, this is not where your political story ends, just a year later, you run for senator and win. You will have a long and respectable career in Washington, after 20 years being primaried by your old enemy, William Langer. But you still leave behind an illustrious legacy, one that stretched far beyond being a potato farmer from Hoople, North Dakota.","no_electoral_majority_message":"<h3>Damn?</h3>","description_as_running_mate":null,"candidate_score":1,"running_mate":false,"scrollable":false}},{"model":"campaign_trail.candidate","pk":142,"fields":{"first_name":"Ragnvald","last_name":"Nestos","election":14,"party":"Republican/IVA","state":"Ward County","priority":1,"description":"<b>not playable currently</b><p>Ragnvald Nestos has been one of millions to come to America in search for a better life and achieve it.
